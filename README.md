 This is the image processing module of a digital camera has to convert the capture raw image data into a full color image. The illustrations of using white balance algorithm Gray World, White Patch, Iterative and Percentile respectively.

## About

This project is a raw image decoder implemented in Python. This code convert the raw image into full color image. In this pipeline we read file in pattern [R G G B] and perform the bilinear demosaic then we can choose the white balance algorithm between Gray World, White Patch, Iterative and Percentile. Finally the code run the gamma correction and give the result image.
